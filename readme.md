# CorruptNation Demo

This project contains a simple demo website for visualizing alleged corruption among politicians in Nepal. It displays a central timeline with items on the left for politicians with no reported corruption and items on the right for those alleged to be corrupt.

The website is purely demonstrative with placeholder data. Replace the entries in `index.html` with accurate information if available.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the timeline layout.

## Files

- `index.html` - main page containing sample timeline entries.
- `style.css` - minimal styling for the timeline layout.
